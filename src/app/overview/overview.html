    The Elizabeth River Trailâ€“Atlantic City Spur runs for 9.5 miles between Harbor Park Stadium and the Norfolk
    International Terminals. The trail occupies a railroad right-of-way yet incorporates a sea-faring history as it
    follows part of Norfolk's waterfront. Here you'll see ships and barges, navy vessels and tankers in the waters of
    Hampton Roads.

    The Elizabeth River continues to be an important adjunct to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic. And because of its
    location, you're likely to see plenty of seabirds, including cormorants, skimmers, ducks and sea gulls.
    <br/><br/>
    Stop by historic Fort Norfolk and see its dungeon, powder magazine and other buildings dating from the early 19th
    century. The fort was commissioned by George Washington in 1794, and you can still climb to the top of its earthen
    embankments for spectacular views of the city and surrounding river.
